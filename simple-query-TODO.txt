simple query TODO

extract simple query logic and share with ExecEx
remove context variants of Exec/Query/QueryRow

remember timestamp and timestamptz support for simple protocol

double check how timestamp would binary encode a time.Time in non-UTC. Since it uses epoch it might shift the time differently than text protocol where postgresql ignores the time zone.

add simple query test to all pgtypes
